3D Car Track Project
This is a 3D car racing simulation project where the car moves on a track according to physics rules. The game includes a timer to track how quickly the player can complete the course. Built using modern 3D rendering and physics libraries, the project provides an engaging experience of physics-based vehicle movement.

Features
Physics-Based Car Movement: The car moves in accordance with real-world physics, including acceleration, friction, and gravity.
Interactive 3D Track: The car runs on a visually immersive 3D track designed to simulate a racing experience.
Timer and Lap Tracker: A timing system tracks how long it takes to complete the track, allowing users to set and beat high scores.
Responsive Controls: Smooth and intuitive controls for steering the car, braking, and accelerating.
Collision Detection: Real-time collision detection ensures the car interacts with track boundaries and obstacles.
End Condition: The game recognizes when the track is completed and can display the time taken to finish.



Tech Stack
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Three Fiber: A React renderer for Three.js, used to build and render the 3D car and track in a declarative way.
React Rapier: A physics engine library that integrates with React for realistic car movement and collision detection.
Three.js: A powerful 3D library used behind the scenes by React Three Fiber for rendering the 3D world.
